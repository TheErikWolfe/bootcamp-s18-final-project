# Drawing Website Description

This website will, simply put, 
* Let you draw pictures
* Let you see what other people have drawn
* Let you upvote and downvote other peoples drawings

## Let you draw pictures

The website will have a page where you can go on and draw whatever you want using a built in canvas (that I have yet to write) where they can choose from different pen styles and colors. Once they have finished writing they will be given a form where they can 'sign' their name and it will put the name they have signed in the bottom right/left hand corner like a signature on a painting.

## Let you see what other people have drawn

Other than the signature in the bottom corner the drawings will remain anonymous. The way the page will be laid out is with dynamic picture sizes that will work with the upvote/downvote system. There will be grid options to see the pictures as all the same size.

## Let you upvote and downvote other peoples drawings

It will work a lot like imgur.com where you can see other people's 'posts' and upvote/downvote them. The more upvotes a picture has, the larger it will get up to a max width, and the more downvotes a picture gets it will get smaller to a min width (but not fully disappear). If the picture has inappropriate content you can report it and it will disappear to the user who has reported it. 

## Reporting System

As previously stated, if someone reports a picture it will disappear for that person. If enough people report it, it will be automatically deleted. If a user has enough pictures get reported then their account will be deactivated. With the anonymous posting it will be hard to target someone by account name if someone was constantly reporting a single person just to be a troll. 

### ToDo(Other than the whole project):
[] Come up with a name for my site. Think of something catchy like twitter/facebook/yikyak/imgur/Instagram
	* Maybe use the word doodle in a clever way.
[] Learn how to use the canvas in html5. Check to see if there is anything better to use.
[] Find an example of a site that has pictures that change in size dynamically

# Why I chose this project

I am not very creative as a person and can not draw to save my life. People who can draw stick figures can already draw better than me. Working on this scares me because it is **EXTREMELY** out of my comfort zone, so I'm doing this web app to really challenge myself. I figure that if I can do this, than what can't I do? When I am working full time as a programmer, my future projects won't always be something I will like or be comfortable with. So it is good to go ahead and start working out of my comfort zone now. As I've always said:
>"If you want to be a hat thief, 
>you better get used to lice".
